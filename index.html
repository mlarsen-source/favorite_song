      <h2>Lyrics</h2>
      <ul class="verse">
        <li>There's a lady who's sure, all that glitters is gold</li>
        <li>And she's buying a stairway to heaven</li>
        <li>When she gets there she knows</li>
        <li>If the stores are all closed</li>
        <li>With a word, she can get what she came for</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="chorus">
        <li>Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh</li>
        <li>And she's buying a stairway to heaven</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse">
        <li>There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure</li>
        <li>Cause you know, sometimes words have two meanings</li>
        <li>In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings</li>
        <li>Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bridge">
        <li>Ooh, it makes me wonder</li>
        <li>Ooh, it makes me wonder</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse">
        <li>There's a feeling I get when I look to the west</li>
        <li>And my spirit is crying for leaving</li>
        <li>In my thoughts, I have seen rings of smoke through the trees</li>
        <li>And the voices of those who stand looking</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bridge">
        <li>Ooh, it makes me wonder</li>
        <li>Ooh, it makes me wonder</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse">
        <li>And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune</li>
        <li>Then the piper will lead us to reason</li>
        <li>And a new day will dawn for those who stand long</li>
        <li>And the forests will echo with laughter</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bridge">
        <li>Whoa-whoa-whoa, oh-oh</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse">
        <li>If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now</li>
        <li>It's just a spring clean for the May Queen</li>
        <li>Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run</li>
        <li>And there's still time to change the road you're on</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bridge">
        <li>And it makes me wonder</li>
        <li>Oh, whoa-oh</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="verse">
        <li>Your head is humming and it won't go</li>
        <li>In case you don't know</li>
        <li>The piper's calling you to join him</li>
        <li>Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?</li>
        <li>And did you know</li>
        <li>Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="hook">
        <li>And as we wind on down the road</li>
        <li>Our shadows taller than our soul</li>
        <li>There walks a lady we all know</li>
        <li>Who shines white light and wants to show</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="hook">
        <li>How everything still turns to gold</li>
        <li>And if you listen very hard</li>
        <li>The tune will come to you at last</li>
        <li>When all are one and one is all, yeah</li>
        <li>To be a rock and not to roll</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="outro">
        <li>And she's buying a stairway to heaven</li>
